## "Filmoteka"

_Hi!_ :wave:

We are students of a group called **"DeVTeaM"** Academies GOIT. :rocket:

After the end of the course **JavaScript** , we needed to **build on** :pushpin:
the knowledge and **implement** :page_with_curl: senior project in week and a
half.

:art: The designers for us have designed **team project layout** -
**“Filmoteka”**.

:hammer_and_wrench: We were also given a ToR with a description of the
functionality future site.

:man_student: The project was worked on by **8 people**. Each of them has been
working on **specific tasks**.

:computer: **Our goal** was to make a site that matches the layout, and and also
performs all the tasks of the TOR. The main purpose of the site is to searching
for a particular movie, as well as user library organization to manage your
movie listings.
